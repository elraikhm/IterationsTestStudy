The purpose of this test is to learn which Iterable or Stream Java constructs are easier to use for certain collection operations (like iterating through , finding an element or sorting).
Feel free to use online help material for Iterable and Stream if needed.
 
You  only  need Java 8 or higher and  Java code editor of your choice ( Eclipse/ IntelliJ/ VSCode) to complete this study.
Open this project with your editor and try to run IterableTasks.java (as Java Application) once before you start working on the tests.
Have manual pages open and handy for you before you start.

The project contains 3 files:
Person.java - holds list of 8 people that can be returned as Iterable<erson> or Stream<Person>. This class provides an input data for the tests you will implement in following 2 files.
StreamTasks.java -  empty class with blank methods you will need to implement using Streams
IterableTasks.java - empty class with blank methods you will need to implement using Iterable and IterableTasks.java

To complete the study you need to finish blank method implementation with both StreamTasks.java and IterableTasks.java. 

Open one of the files (StreamTasks.java or IterableTasks.java) in your editor and follow instructions provided in this file. 
Make sure to start with the file provided to you in the test request.

Each class has task1, task2 and task3 methods which are required to complete and extraTask1 and extraTask2 methods which are optional.
If the total time to complete  first 3 tasks in the first file is longer than 40 minutes, do not implement the extraTask1 and extraTask2.
If you implemented extraTask1 and extraTask2 methods in the first file, please complete their implementation in the second file as well.

If specific method implementation takes longer than 15 minutes, feel free to abandon it and proceed with the next task.
After you are done with the first file, please share the test feedback and start with the second file after that.
Thank you for participating in our user testing!
